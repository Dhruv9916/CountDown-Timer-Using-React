## ðŸš€ Learning from this Project

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience with the following concepts:

- **State Management**: Efficiently handling and updating component states in React.
- **useEffect Hook**: Understanding how to properly use `useEffect` for side effects.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamically displaying components based on conditions.
- **setInterval Function**: Implementing timers in React using `setInterval`.
- **Code Separation**: Organizing code into reusable and maintainable components.

This project serves as a great example of how to manage time-based events in React while maintaining clean and structured code. ðŸš€
